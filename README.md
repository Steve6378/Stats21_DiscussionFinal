# Stats 21 Discussion Final

This is the final project for the discussion section of Stats 21 Spring 23. This project focuses on the usage of Streamlit to faciliate basic exploratory data analysis (refer to Usage below).

## Installation

Included in the repository is `requirements.txt`, which can be used to directly install the packages through `pip install -r requirements.txt`. The packages used are Streamlit, matplotlib, Seaborn and Pandas.

## Usage

The project provides basic EDA techniques such as showing the dataset, generally analyzing it and then focusing on a categorical/numeric column for more detailed analysis and graphing. To start, simply upload the dataset, and after the general analysis is done, pick a column that needs to be analyzed.
